configuration:
  repository:
    name: Repository
    description: Git URL to your repository.
  git_branch:
    name: Git Branch
    description: >-
      Branch name of the Git repo. If left empty, the currently checked out
      branch will be updated. Leave this as 'master' if you are unsure.
  git_remote:
    name: Git Remote
    description: >-
      Name of the tracked repository. Leave this as `origin` if you are unsure.

  restart_ignore:
    name: Restart Ignore

    description: Command to run. Leave this as `pull` if you are unsure.
  git_prune:
    name: Git Prune

      If enabled, the app will clean-up branches that are deleted on the
      remote repository, but still have cached entries on the local machine.
      Leave this as `false` if you are unsure.
  deploy_delete:
    name: Deploy Delete
    description: >-
      If enabled, files in /config that are not present in the repository will
      be removed during deploy (mirror semantics). Protected paths (.storage,
      secrets.yaml, databases, etc.) are always excluded. Leave this as `false`
      if you are unsure -- the default is additive-only.
  deploy_dry_run:
    name: Deploy Dry Run
    description: >-
      If enabled, the addon will report what files would be added, changed, or
      deleted by a deploy without actually modifying /config. Useful for
      previewing deploy_delete behavior before enabling it. The addon exits
      after the report.
  mirror_protect_user_dirs:
    name: Mirror Protect User Dirs
    description: >-
      When enabled (default), the directories www/ and python_scripts/ are

    name: Allow Legacy Config Git Dir
    description: >-
      If /config/.git exists (from an older addon version), the addon will
